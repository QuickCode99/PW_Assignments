        "   A Web API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with software applications. It enables different software systems to communicate over the internet using HTTP protocols. Web APIs allow client applications (like web browsers or mobile apps) to access and manipulate data on a server through defined endpoints.\n",
